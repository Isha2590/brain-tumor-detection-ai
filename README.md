# Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN
This project is an academic implementation of a brain tumor detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model classifies MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories and supports real-time image upload and prediction in JupyterLab.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- CNN
- JupyterLab

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

The dataset contains labeled MRI images categorized into tumor and non-tumor classes.

> Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to size and licensing considerations. Please download it directly from Kaggle.
